XXXgen
=======

XXXgen is a tool to randomly generate fake papers, depending on the input rules.

The mathgen rule files are provided for convenience.

Source code (Github): https://github.com/moshbear/mathgen

Running
=======

The main XXXgen program is `xxxgen.py'.

Run
$ python xxxgen.py < RULE_FILE 
or
$ python xxxgen.py RULE_FILE

Output is standard output. Writing to file can be implemented with two or so lines of code.

Explicitly specifying authors is unimplemented.

Source code
===========

A quick road map to the files in the source distribution:

- xxxgen.py: Main driver file, processes options and disposes of
  output.

- xxxgen/lib.py: The SCIgen grammar engine.  Reads the rules files and
  generates the output.

- scirules.in: Common grammar rules, included into the following
  files.

- sci{article,book,blurb}.in: Grammar rules specific for the
  corresponding products.
